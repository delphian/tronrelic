## Custom User Created Pages

Let's talk about custom, user created, pages. I would like a new backend module, colocated components, similar file structure layout as modules/menu and services/system-log. This new module will be called 'pages'. The purpose of this module is to allow the admin to create custom pages on the site, such as articles, blog posts, etc. I don't foresee a need for page types.
