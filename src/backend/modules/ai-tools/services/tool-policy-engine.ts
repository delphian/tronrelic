/**
 * @file tool-policy-engine.ts
 *
 * Decides whether a tool invocation may proceed, must be held for human
 * approval, or is denied. Defaults derive from the tool's capability class and
 * are overridable per tool by an admin. A fixed-window rate limiter caps
 * invocations per tool and globally, protecting upstream providers and the
 * model's context budget from a looping or prompt-injected agent. A paid tool's
 * spend is capped the same way: because windowed spend is `calls × costPerCall`,
 * the dollar ceiling is enforced as a cap on the number of calls
 * (`floor(costCeilingUsd / costPerCallUsd)`) per window — one counter, no float
 * accumulator.
 *
 * The counters are backed by Redis when a client is injected, so the limits are
 * a single shared budget across every backend instance and survive a restart —
 * the same `INCR`+`EXPIRE` fixed-window primitive the platform's API rate
 * limiter uses (`services/rate-limit.service.ts`). When no client is present
 * (unit tests) or a Redis call fails (outage), the engine degrades to a
 * process-local in-memory counter: fail-safe per-instance limiting, never
 * fail-open and never a self-inflicted denial.
 *
 * The engine is provider-neutral and owns no I/O beyond loading and persisting
 * admin overrides through the injected database and incrementing the rate
 * counters through the injected Redis client.
